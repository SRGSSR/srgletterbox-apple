/**
 *  The Letterbox controller manages media playback, as well as retrieval and updates of the associated metadata. It 
 *  also takes care of errors, in particular those related to network issues, and automatically resumes when a connection
 *  becomes available.
 *
 *  Applications can use a Letterbox controller to play some content in the background. If they need to display what
 *  is being played, a Letterbox controller needs to be bound to a Letterbox view (@see `SRGLetterboxView`). By integrating
 *  this view into their own hierarchy, and by listening to metadata and error controller notifications, applications can
 *  provide rich playback interfaces with contextual information about the content currently being played.
 *
 *  Letterbox controllers can also be integrated with application-wide features like AirPlay or picture in picture.
 *  Such features can only be enabled for at most one controller at a time by starting the Letterbox service singleton
 *  for this controller (@see `SRGLetterboxService`). Your application is free to use as many controllers as needed, 
 *  though, and you can change at any time which controller is enabled for such services.
 *
 *  When the `SRGAnalytics` tracker singleton has been properly started, controllers are automatically tracked. This
 *  behavior can be disabled by setting the `tracked` property to `NO`. If the tracker singleton has not been started,
 *  analytics won't be collected.
